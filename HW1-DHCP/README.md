# Homework 1
Run the `run.sh` script to (re)start the service.
It cannot automatically configure after boot.

# Notes
For unknown reason, I have to ping 10.113.0.254 manually to initial the connection.
Before that I can only establish connection inside-out, outside cannot reach my network.
And this will be expired after maybe minutes of idle.
